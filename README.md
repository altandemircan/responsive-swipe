Responsive Swipe
================

Demo site illustrating the splendid Responsive Swipe jQuery plugin, which enables you to create a responsive content (RESS) site that is swipeable on touch devices. Documentation is included in this code, which you can see in action at <a href="http://humbleself.com/responsive-swipe/">http://humbleself.com/responsive-swipe/</a>.

This demo requires a web server with PHP.

For the plugin itself, just check out responsive.swipe.js and swipeview.js in the /js folder. See the example in outer_page_bits.php for how to initalise it.

See Stephan's <a href="https://github.com/stephanfowler/responsive-swipe">repo of the plugin</a> for more details, and see Cubiq's <a href="https://github.com/cubiq/SwipeView">SwipeView</a> repo for the original SwipeView carousel. (We include a fork of SwipeView in this code.)
